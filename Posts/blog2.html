                <article>
                    <p>Second day. Opened the website on Chrome (since it's my default browser right now) and discovered that the image positioning for my sample card is different than on Firefox.</p>
                    <p>Actually, it was overflowing, but that was fixed with "overflow: hidden", but in Chrome, the image was positioned so that you see the top-left of the image, and for Firefox, it's positioned at the bottom-left even though I have "object-position: bottom left".</p>
                    <p>Then I tried some other settings. With <mark>50% 50%</mark>, Firefox responds, but Chrome stays the same. For now, I'm gonna ignore it for now and deal with it later. I'm more concerned with the positioning of my card list.</p>
                    <p><i>I was eventually able to fix this still with 50% 50%, though I don't remember how because that wasn't in my notes. I think I just had to refresh. I should've taken more pictures.</i></p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../assets/images/firefox_vs_chrome_image_positioning.png" alt="Picture of two windows showing the same image element. The left is Firefox and the right being Chrome in a wider window." />
                        <figcaption>Now they are positioned the same in both browsers.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>After that, I used flexbox and adjusted some media queries to finish some responsiveness. But on smaller screens, such as for my S9, the h1 text with a word that's a little too long is getting in the way. So need to have a media query for that too.<i>Also, it was around this time I had discovered the importance of <mark>setting the viewport meta data</mark> in order for things to show up properly in mobile. Previously, looking at the Responsive View in DevTools, the site looked super zoomed out.</i></p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../assets/images/snapshot_of_head.png" alt ="Picture showing the head tag in html." />
                        <figcaption>The 'viewport' meta setting the device width and scale displayed the app the way I expected it on mobile.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Those media queries <mark>helped a lot</mark>. Everything now has much better responsiveness compared to the previous format I had before. The only thing is, I did want to set up flexbox so that there are cards that auto-adjust to fill the entire row, but it wouldn't grow to fill the last row. That one's a tricky one, but a smaller detail I'll also leave for later.</p>

                    <p>The Blog Post Page I'm going to <mark>keep it simple</mark> so I can move on to adding more elements and not focusing on the design too much. <i>Plus, I think it's easier to read when there's less random stuff on the page anyways.</i></p>
                    <p>I'm going to need links to other posts (ie. a simple 'previous' and 'next' will be fitting), and a subscription field at the bottom, very much like some other sites like Medium.</p>
                    <p>With that idea in mind, I'll be adding both of those things in the footer,  though I'll need to change the Grid template. I should handle this before I make more posts since my header and footer will basically be the same across all pages. Also, I forgot to add a date and name for the posts. Actually, I need an avatar too.</p>

                        <figcaption>I totally look like this guy from Unsplash.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>I'll start with a simple three button row at the bottom on the footer. I'm going to add the wireframing for the User Summary and the Subscribe Form first before I get into the details because my main concern here is the responsiveness of those three elements.</p>
                    <p><i>I've noted before that the User Summary looks very similar to the Card I use for the Most Recent Post.</i>I have the option of making it a card and adjusting. But there are some differences between the two, perhaps enough for me to think that I'll just stick with <i>creating another set of classes for it</i>. That way, I can also have it in the footer.css and there'd be a little less confusion. Plus, I don't really want the padding effect on the Summary.</p>
                    <p>So I created the Avatar and everything ignoring a small pixel difference in Chrome, <i>which was later fixed with a slightly wider border</i>. But now I'll need to consider how things are on a bigger screen.</p>

                        <figcaption>This is what it eventually looked like on mobile. See the flexbox resemblance with the Blog Cards on the Homepage?</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>I like having the footer fill the width, makes it a bit more dynamic, but the content, I don't want it to fill the width, but I also don't want it to really also be limited to the width of my content. I want to have it so that there's a max all the elements in the footer, and flex will take care of rearranging them from vertical to horizontal. The footer's background itself will <mark>"blend" the elements together</mark> so it doesn't look as patchy.</p>
                    <p>The concern I have though, is how the navbar on the bottom is going to work. Leaving it to fill the width seems weird. Maybe instead of using space-between and pushing buttons to the far left and right, I can center them and space it myself, making it more like a mobile navigator.</p>
